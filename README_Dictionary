Dictionary.java is an interactive spelling bee like sort of game. The user is
provided with the definition and length of a word. Given these two 
hints, the user then tries to "guess" what the word is by inputing one 
letter at a time. Moreover, a sequence of dashes is shown to the user and will
be filled by correct letters the user guesses. The number of dashes equals
the number of letters in the word. User also has 3 tries to guess
incorrectly. 

TRY IT OUT :)

Hello,

So for my first project, I thought a simple calculator that performs basic operations such as addition, division, and mean is a good start. 
The code uses functions that are passed by reference to execute the desired operation, when called in main(). Furthermore, I made it to be 
very user interactive; it asks the user what operation they would like to perform. To select an operation, I used the case switch method since 
it is easier to implement and follow as a reader/debugger. 

I also have developed a java calculator GUI by implementing swing framework.It performs single value operations; meaning it takes 1 value per field.

Thanks!

# Hello-World
Mission Initiated

Hello Fellow Coders,

My name is Elhadi and I am an electrical engineering student. I have developed a recent passion for programming. My favorite languages are C++ and Java. I consider myself a beginner when it comes to determining my level of experience. I would like to develop my knowledge in the field through practice and feedback. By developing great knowledge in programming: 1) I would like to share what I learn. 2) I aspire to work at big tech firms/companies such as Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, etcc..
